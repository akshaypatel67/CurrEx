## Description

### Project Definition
This is a Currency Analysis project that modules with different currencies and compares them with The American Dollar.
This module shows the current date rate of the currencies with respect to the American Dollar. Furthermore the graph analysis are also done sectionwise.
Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly currency rate graphs are shown with maximum and minimum currency rate in the given range of dates.

### Motivation
We were given a problem statement for developing a module that shows the currency conversions with respect to the American dolllar. As this is one of the most interesting projects that includes graph analysis and Maximum and Minimum data for the given range, we were motivated to work on this project as it would challenge our programming skills and UI/UX skills.

## Gettting Started

### Running the Project
In order to view the project,we need to open the index.html file attached above.

### Features
<li> In the first page of the module we can view the currency exchange rate for different currencies with respect to the American Dollar for the current date </li>รง
<li> The second page of the module allow users to select currency and desired duration. Users can access the functionality to switch between weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual charts. We fetched the data for given currency and time duration and previewed rate vs date graph for a given period. We analysed the date on which the rate was highest and lowest for the given duration of time.</li>
<li>
The third page of the module allows users to convert the currencies of their choice and also the unit functionality is given so that users can convert the exact amount of their currency into their desired currency.
